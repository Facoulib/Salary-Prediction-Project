# Salary Prediction Project

The objective of the project is to examine a set of job postings with their corresponding salaries and then predict salaries for a new set of job postings.
This project and its reuslts can have various applications such as:
- helping companies and Human Resources departments to estimate the appropriate salaries of their future employees. 
- allowing job seekers to negotiate a suitable salary with knowledge of different salary averages.
- assisting federal and state governments to evaluate the current salaries trend in the job market.
